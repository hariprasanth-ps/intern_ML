Day 1 of learning FastAPI:
---------------------------

FastAPI:
-------
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. 
The key features are: Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). 
One of the fastest Python frameworks available.

User Interfaces with FastAPI:
		1.	Swagger UI
		2.	ReDoc
1.	Swagger UI:
		The Swagger UI is an open source project to visually render documentation for an API defined with the OpenAPI (Swagger) Specification.
This interface used for:
		Swagger UI allows anyone be it your development team or your end consumers to visualize and interact with the API's resources without 
	having any of the implementation logic in place.
2.	ReDoc:
		Redoc is a popular display framework for the OpenAPI as well and is a favorite by many API gurus. Redoc started out as a API doc site 
	for Rebilly docs but with many customizations evolved into its own unique framework.
This interface used for:
		Redoc is an open-source tool that generates API documentation from OpenAPI specifications. It's one of the most powerful free docs 
	tools in the industry, producing clean, customizable documentation with an attractive three-panel design.

Type hints:
----------

Type hints give us more precisioned results while using autocomplete.

Code example 1:	
--------------

@app.get("/items/{name}")
async def get_items(name: str):
	return {"name" :name}
	
print(get_items("sundar"))		
		
if __name__ == '__main__':
uvicorn.run(app,host="127.0.0.1",port=8000)

		1.	So now as we already pass in the type hint the autocomplete gives as suggestions related to the data type specified.
		2.	In addition to that you get error analyis on the go 

Run:
---
python3 app.py

uvicorn app:app --reload
